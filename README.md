# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marina and now Iâ€™m learning JavaScript through self-study by using the [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) React course, and getting feedback from my mentor. I have practical experience in JavaScript, a bit of TypeScript, CSS, HTML, HTML DOM, and React framework. I aim to deepen my skills in frontend development and to introduce myself to backend development in the nearest future.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies and tools I use:

### Programming Exercises

Programming assignments I did when I took my first steps in learning to code. Here you can find many different small programs, ranging from simple algorithms to things like tic-tac-toe with a computer opponent and a Wordle-type game.
